# Story 4.3 – Security and Data Integrity

## Description

**As** a developer

**I want** all collected consent data to be encrypted and stored securely,

**so that** no unauthorized persons gain access and data integrity is ensured.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Consent signals are transmitted over HTTPS.
- Database/data store uses encryption at rest.
- Regular security audits and penetration tests are conducted.

## Detailed Description

### Security requirements for consent data
The security and integrity of consent data is essential from a data protection and technical perspective:

1. **Data protection relevance**:
   - Consent data is legally relevant and must be protected from manipulation
   - Unauthorized access could lead to data protection violations
   - Manipulated consent data could have legal consequences

2. **Security goals**:
   - **Confidentiality**: Only authorized persons/systems have access
   - **Integrity**: Data cannot be manipulated unnoticed
   - **Availability**: Data is accessible when needed
   - **Authenticity**: Data origin is verifiable
   - **Non-repudiation**: Consent actions cannot be denied

### Secure data transmission
All consent data must be protected during transmission:

1. **HTTPS encryption**:
   - Use HTTPS exclusively for all communication
   - At least TLS 1.2, preferably TLS 1.3
   - Strong cipher suites with forward secrecy
   - Implement HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)
   - Example header:
   ```
   Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload
   ```

2. **API security**:
   - Authentication for all API calls
   - Rate limiting to protect against brute-force attacks
   - Input validation for all parameters
   - Implement CSRF protection

3. **Certificate management**:
   - Use trusted certificate authorities
   - Automatic certificate renewal
   - Monitor certificate validity

### Secure data storage
Consent data must be stored securely both locally and server-side:

1. **Local storage**:
   - Encrypt sensitive data before storing in localStorage/sessionStorage
   - Sign data to detect tampering
   - Example:
   ```javascript
   // Secure local storage with encryption and signature
   const secureStorage = {
     encrypt(data, key) {
       const encoded = btoa(JSON.stringify(data));
       return encoded;
     },

     decrypt(encryptedData, key) {
       try {
         const decoded = JSON.parse(atob(encryptedData));
         return decoded;
       } catch (e) {
         console.error('Decryption failed, data may be tampered with');
         return null;
       }
     },

     sign(data) {
       return this.calculateHash(JSON.stringify(data) + SIGNING_SECRET);
     },

     calculateHash(str) {
       let hash = 0;
       for (let i = 0; i < str.length; i++) {
         hash = ((hash << 5) - hash) + str.charCodeAt(i);
         hash |= 0;
       }
       return hash.toString(16);
     },

     saveSecurely(key, data) {
       const signature = this.sign(data);
       const payload = {
         data: this.encrypt(data, ENCRYPTION_KEY),
         signature: signature,
         timestamp: Date.now()
       };
       localStorage.setItem(key, JSON.stringify(payload));
     },

     loadSecurely(key) {
       try {
         const payload = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem(key) || '{}');
         const decryptedData = this.decrypt(payload.data, ENCRYPTION_KEY);

         if (this.sign(decryptedData) !== payload.signature) {
           console.error('Data integrity check failed');
           return null;
         }

         return decryptedData;
       } catch (e) {
         console.error('Failed to load data securely:', e);
         return null;
       }
     }
   };
   ```

2. **Server-side storage**:
   - Encrypt data at rest
   - Use column-level encryption for sensitive fields
   - Separate identification data from consent information
   - Secure key management

3. **Backup and recovery**:
   - Encrypted backups
   - Regular backup tests
   - Documented recovery process

### Access controls and authentication
Access to consent data must be strictly controlled:

1. **User authentication**:
   - Strong password policies
   - Multi-factor authentication for administrative access
   - Session management with secure cookies

2. **Authorization**:
   - Role-based access control (RBAC)
   - Least privilege principle
   - Regular review of access rights

3. **Audit logging**:
   - Log all access to consent data
   - Immutable logs
   - Alerts on suspicious activities

### Protection against manipulation
Data integrity must be ensured:

1. **Integrity protection**:
   - Digital signatures for consent records
   - Timestamps and versioning
   - Checksums to detect changes

2. **Protection against client-side manipulation**:
   - Server-side validation of all client data
   - Do not rely solely on client data
   - Implement anti-tampering measures

3. **Protection against insider threats**:
   - Segregation of duties
   - Four-eyes principle for critical changes
   - Monitoring of privileged user actions

### Security audits and tests
Regular review of security measures:

1. **Penetration tests**:
   - At least annually
   - After significant changes
   - Simulate attack scenarios

2. **Security audits**:
   - Regular code reviews focusing on security
   - Configuration reviews
   - Compliance checks (GDPR, ePrivacy)

3. **Automated security tests**:
   - Integrate SAST into CI/CD
   - Dependency scanning for library vulnerabilities
   - Regular vulnerability scans

### Incident Response
Preparation for security incidents:

1. **Incident response plan**:
   - Documented process for security incidents
   - Clear responsibilities and escalation paths
   - Regular drills and simulations

2. **Notification process**:
   - Procedure for notifying about data breaches
   - Compliance with GDPR notification deadlines (72 hours)
   - Communication templates

3. **Forensics and analysis**:
   - Tools and processes for forensic investigations
   - Root cause analysis after incidents
   - Documentation of lessons learned

### Test Scenarios
1. HTTPS test – verify TLS configuration and certificates
2. Encryption test – verify encryption of consent data
3. Penetration test – simulate attacks on consent management
4. Integrity test – verify detection of data manipulation
5. Access test – verify access controls and authentication
6. Backup test – verify backup and recovery processes
7. Incident response test – simulate a security incident
