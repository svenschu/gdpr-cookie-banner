# Story 4.4 – Scalability and Multi-Tenancy

## Description

**As** an administrator

**I want** the banner to be usable across multiple domains and tenants with different configurations,

**so that** our company can manage central settings while making individual adjustments per domain.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Multiple tenants can be created in the system.
- Each domain can have its own texts, colors and category settings while the core logic remains identical.
- Consent logs are evaluated across domains but kept separate per tenant.

## Detailed Description

### Multi-tenancy
The solution must provide true multi-tenancy to support different business units or clients:

1. **Tenant model**:
   - Hierarchical structure: organization → tenant → domain
   - Clear separation of data between tenants
   - Flexible permission structures within tenants
   - Example structure: (tree as provided)

2. **Tenant management**:
   - User-friendly interface to manage tenants
   - Easy addition, editing and deactivation of tenants
   - Import/export functions for tenant configurations

3. **Data isolation**:
   - Strict separation of data between tenants
   - Tenant-specific encryption
   - No cross-tenant access without explicit permission

### Domain-specific configurations
Each domain must be configurable individually while core logic is centrally managed:

1. **Configuration levels**:
   - Global configuration (applies to all tenants)
   - Tenant-specific configuration (applies to all domains of a tenant)
   - Domain-specific configuration (applies to a specific domain)
   - Inheritance hierarchy with override options

2. **Configurable elements**:
   - **Appearance**: colors, fonts, logos, positioning
   - **Texts and translations**: all text elements in multiple languages
   - **Cookie categories**: customizable categories and descriptions
   - **Behavior**: timing, animations, interaction patterns
   - **Legal settings**: privacy policy, imprint, links
   - **Technical parameters**: Google Consent Mode settings, tracking IDs

3. **Configuration interface**:
   - User-friendly UI for non-technical administrators
   - Preview function for changes
   - Versioning of configurations
   - Example JSON configuration structure (as provided)

### Technical Scalability
The solution must scale technically to support many domains and high user numbers:

1. **Horizontal scalability**:
   - Microservices architecture for independent scaling of components
   - Containerization (e.g., Docker) for easy deployment
   - Orchestration (e.g., Kubernetes) for automatic scaling

2. **Performance optimization**:
   - Content Delivery Network (CDN) for global distribution
   - Caching at multiple levels (browser, CDN, API)
   - Lazy loading of resources

3. **Database scaling**:
   - Sharding for large data volumes
   - Read replicas for high read loads
   - Caching layer for frequently accessed data

### Central Management and Reporting
The solution must enable central management and cross-domain reporting:

1. **Central dashboard**:
   - Overview of all tenants and domains
   - Aggregated statistics and KPIs
   - Drill-down functionality for detailed analysis

2. **Reporting functions**:
   - Cross-domain evaluation of consent rates
   - Comparison between domains and tenants
   - Trend analyses over time
   - Export options in various formats

3. **Audit and compliance**:
   - Central logging of all changes
   - Tenant-specific audit logs
   - Compliance reports for different jurisdictions

### Deployment and Distribution
The solution must be easy to deploy on different domains:

1. **Deployment options**:
   - JavaScript snippet for simple integration
   - Tag manager integration (Google Tag Manager, Adobe Launch)
   - Server-side integration for maximum control
   - Example snippet (as provided)

2. **Automated deployment**:
   - CI/CD pipeline for continuous updates
   - Rollback mechanisms for issues
   - A/B testing support for new features

3. **Versioning**:
   - Semantic versioning of core components
   - Backward compatibility for older configurations
   - Migration tools for configuration updates

### API and Integrations
The solution must be extensible via APIs and integrable with other systems:

1. **RESTful API**:
   - Full API documentation (e.g., OpenAPI/Swagger)
   - Authentication and authorization for API access
   - Rate limiting and quotas

2. **Webhooks**:
   - Event-based notifications for consent changes
   - Configurable webhook endpoints per tenant
   - Retry mechanisms for delivery issues

3. **Third-party integrations**:
   - CMP certifications (Google, IAB TCF)
   - CRM systems for customer data synchronization
   - Analytics platforms for advanced evaluations

### Test Scenarios
1. Multi-tenant test – verify data isolation between tenants
2. Configuration test – adjust and override settings at different levels
3. Scaling test – behavior under high load and many simultaneous users
4. Deployment test – deployment on different domains and environments
5. Reporting test – cross-domain evaluation of consent data
6. API test – access and manipulate configurations via the API
7. Migration test – update configurations when versions change
