# Epic 4: Technical and Non-Functional Requirements

## Epic Description

This epic covers all technical and non-functional requirements for the cookie banner system. The system should meet the highest standards in accessibility, performance, security, and scalability to provide a robust, user-friendly, production-ready solution.

## Business Value

- **User friendliness**: Accessible solution allows all users to access cookie settings
- **Performance excellence**: Optimal load times and minimal impact on website performance
- **Security**: Protection of sensitive consent data through state-of-the-art security standards
- **Scalability**: Efficient multi-domain and multi-tenant architecture for business growth

## Scope and Exclusions

### In Scope:
- WCAG 2.1 AA-compliant accessibility and responsive design
- Performance optimization with defined metrics and monitoring
- Comprehensive security measures for data transfer and storage
- Multi-tenant architecture for scalable cross-domain usage
- Monitoring, alerting, and audit functionalities

### Out of Scope:
- Specific cloud provider implementations (configured individually)
- Advanced analytics features (handled in separate epics)
- Third-party integrations outside the core system

## User Stories

This epic includes the following user stories:

- **[Story 4.1](user_stories/story_4.1_accessibility_and_responsive_design.md)** – Accessibility and responsive design
- **[Story 4.2](user_stories/story_4.2_performance_and_stability.md)** – Performance and stability
- **[Story 4.3](user_stories/story_4.3_security_and_data_integrity.md)** – Security and data integrity
- **[Story 4.4](user_stories/story_4.4_scalability_and_multi_tenancy.md)** – Scalability and multi-tenancy

## Technical Framework

### Architectural Principles

- **Accessibility First**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance as baseline for all UI components
- **Performance by Design**: Asynchronous architecture with minimal impact on website performance
- **Security by Default**: End-to-end encryption and secure authentication as standard
- **Scalability First**: Multi-tenant architecture for horizontal scaling from the outset

### Quality Requirements

- **Accessibility**: Full WCAG 2.1 AA compliance with keyboard navigation and screen reader support
- **Performance**: Defined metrics for load times and minimal blocking time
- **Security**: TLS 1.3 encryption, AES-256 data encryption and role-based access control
- **Scalability**: Multi-domain and multi-tenant support with automatic scaling

### Integration Requirements

- **Responsive Design**: Optimization for all device types and screen sizes
- **Cross-browser compatibility**: Support for all common browsers
- **API Integration**: RESTful APIs for configuration and monitoring
- **Monitoring integration**: Comprehensive logging and alerting system

## Priority and Dependencies

**Priority**: Medium to high priority (P1-P2)

**Rationale**: This epic is essential for production readiness and user experience. The non-functional requirements are critical for acceptance and legal compliance of the system, especially accessibility and performance requirements.

**Dependencies**:
- Incoming dependencies: Epic 1 (consent banner core functions) must be completed
- Technical infrastructure: Cloud infrastructure and CI/CD pipeline must be provided
- Monitoring tools: Monitoring stack and security scanning tools must be available
- Organizational requirements: Performance budgets and security policies must be defined

## Acceptance Criteria (Epic Level)

- **Accessibility**: Full WCAG 2.1 AA compliance is proven and tested
- **Performance excellence**: All defined performance metrics are met without affecting the website
- **Security compliance**: Comprehensive security measures are implemented and audited
- **Scalability readiness**: Multi-tenant architecture is fully functional
- **Monitoring completeness**: Comprehensive monitoring and alerting is production ready
