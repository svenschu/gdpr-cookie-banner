# Epic 1: Consent Banner Core Functions

## Epic Description

This epic encompasses the implementation of the basic functions of a GDPR-compliant cookie banner. The system should
provide EU website visitors with a transparent and user-friendly way to grant or refuse consent to cookie categories.

## Business Value

- **Legal Compliance**: Fulfilment of GDPR requirements for cookie consent
- **Trust Building**: Transparent data processing strengthens user trust
- **Risk Minimisation**: Avoidance of fines and legal consequences
- **International Scalability**: Foundation for further regional compliance requirements

## Scope and Exclusions

### In Scope:

- GDPR-compliant cookie banner for EU visitors
- Equivalent accept/reject options
- Granular cookie-category settings
- Withdrawal options and preference management
- Multilingual support (DE/EN) and geo-targeting
- Blocking of non-essential cookies until consent is given

### Out of Scope:

- Compliance for other regions (CCPA, etc.) – handled in separate epics
- Integration of specific third-party tools – handled in Epic 2
- Advanced analytics and reporting – handled in Epic 3

## User Stories

The epic includes the following user stories:

- **[Story 1.1](user_stories/story_1.1_display_banner_and_block_cookies.md)** – Display banner and block cookies
- **[Story 1.2](user_stories/story_1.2_equivalent_accept_all_and_reject_all_button.md)** – Equivalent “Accept all” and “Reject all” button
- **[Story 1.3](user_stories/story_1.3_granular_cookie_settings.md)** – Granular cookie settings
- **[Story 1.4](user_stories/story_1.4_withdraw_and_change_preferences.md)** – Withdraw and change preferences
- **[Story 1.5](user_stories/story_1.5_multilingual_and_geo_targeting.md)** – Multilingual support and geo-targeting
- **[Story 1.6](user_stories/story_1.6_consent_expiration.md)** – Consent expiration

## Technical Framework

### Architectural Principles

- **Privacy by Design**: Default blocking of all non-essential cookies
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Core website functions remain available without cookie consent
- **Responsive Design**: Banner works on all device types and screen sizes
- **Performance**: Minimal impact on page load times

### Compliance Requirements

- **GDPR Compliance**: Fulfilment of all relevant GDPR articles
- **No Dark Patterns**: Equivalent presentation of all options
- **Transparency**: Clear and understandable information about data processing
- **Revocability**: Consent can be changed at any time

### Integration Requirements

- **Geo-Targeting**: Automatic detection of EU/EEA visitors
- **Multilingual Support**: Support for at least DE and EN
- **Cookie Management**: Central control of all cookie categories
- **Persistence**: Storage of user settings

## Priority and Dependencies

**Priority**: Highest priority (P0)

**Rationale**: This epic forms the legal and technical foundation for all further cookie-management functions and is
essential for GDPR compliance.

**Dependencies**:

- No incoming dependencies
- Outgoing dependencies: Epic 2 (third-party integration) and Epic 3 (compliance & audit) build on this epic

## Acceptance Criteria (Epic Level)

- **Functional Completeness**: All defined user stories are fully implemented
- **GDPR Compliance**: Full fulfilment of the legal requirements for cookie consent
- **Usability**: Intuitive operation without dark patterns or manipulative elements
- **Technical Quality**: Performance-optimised implementation with minimal impact on page load times
- **Internationalisation**: Full support for DE and EN with an extensible architecture
