# Story 1.6 â€“ Consent Expiration

## Description

**As** a website operator

**I want** cookie consent to automatically expire after a defined period,

**so that** users are periodically asked to renew their consent and the system remains compliant with data protection best practices.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Cookie consent expires automatically after a configurable period (default: 12 months)
- When consent has expired, the banner is shown again on the next visit
- Expired consent is treated the same as no consent (non-essential cookies are blocked)
- The expiration period can be configured via a component property
- Consent expiration is checked on every page load/component initialization

## Detailed Description

### Consent Expiration Logic
The system must automatically invalidate stored consent after a specified time period:

1. **Expiration Period**:
   - Default expiration period: 12 months (365 days)
   - Configurable via component property `consentExpirationDays`
   - Minimum allowed period: 30 days
   - Maximum recommended period: 24 months

2. **Expiration Check**:
   - Performed on every component initialization
   - Compares current timestamp with stored consent timestamp
   - If difference exceeds expiration period, consent is considered invalid

3. **Behavior on Expiration**:
   - Expired consent is treated as no consent
   - Banner is displayed again
   - Non-essential cookies are blocked until new consent is given
   - Old consent data is removed from storage

### Technical Implementation

1. **Configuration Property**:
   ```typescript
   @property({ type: Number })
   consentExpirationDays: number = 365; // Default 12 months
   ```

2. **Expiration Validation**:
   - Modify `_getStoredConsent()` method to include expiration check
   - Calculate age of consent: `(Date.now() - consent.timestamp) / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24)`
   - Return `null` if consent age exceeds `consentExpirationDays`

3. **Automatic Cleanup**:
   - Remove expired consent from localStorage
   - Reset component state to initial values

### Business Requirements

This feature addresses several important aspects:

1. **Data Protection Compliance**:
   - Ensures consent remains current and informed
   - Prevents indefinite storage of outdated consent decisions
   - Aligns with privacy-by-design principles

2. **User Rights**:
   - Provides regular opportunities to reconsider consent decisions
   - Ensures users are reminded of data processing activities
   - Maintains transparency about ongoing data collection

3. **Legal Best Practices**:
   - Many privacy experts recommend periodic consent renewal
   - Helps demonstrate ongoing compliance efforts
   - Reduces risk of using outdated or invalid consent

### Configuration Examples

```html
<!-- Default 12 months expiration -->
<gdpr-cookie-banner></gdpr-cookie-banner>

<!-- Custom 6 months expiration -->
<gdpr-cookie-banner consent-expiration-days="180"></gdpr-cookie-banner>

<!-- Minimum 30 days expiration -->
<gdpr-cookie-banner consent-expiration-days="30"></gdpr-cookie-banner>
```

### Test Scenarios

1. **Default Expiration Test**: Verify consent expires after 365 days
2. **Custom Expiration Test**: Verify custom expiration periods work correctly
3. **Boundary Test**: Test minimum (30 days) and maximum (730 days) values
4. **Clock Manipulation Test**: Simulate time passage to test expiration logic
5. **Storage Cleanup Test**: Verify expired consent is removed from localStorage
6. **Banner Display Test**: Confirm banner appears when consent has expired
7. **Cookie Blocking Test**: Verify non-essential cookies are blocked after expiration

### Integration with Existing Stories

This story extends the functionality of:
- **Story 1.1**: Adds expiration logic to banner display conditions
- **Story 1.4**: Expired consent triggers the same flow as withdrawn consent
- **Story 3.1**: Consent expiration events should be logged for audit purposes

### Legal Considerations

While GDPR doesn't explicitly require consent expiration, this feature supports:
- **Article 7(3)**: Right to withdraw consent at any time
- **Recital 32**: Consent should be informed and current
- **Privacy by Design**: Proactive privacy protection measures
- **Best Practice Compliance**: Industry recommendations for consent management
