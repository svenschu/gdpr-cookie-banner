# Story 1.5 – Multilingualism and Geo-Targeting

## Description

**As** an international company

**I want** EU visitors to see a GDPR-compliant banner in their language and users from other regions to potentially see a different banner,

**so that** we meet legal requirements depending on the region.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Geo-targeting detects EU/EEA IP addresses and displays a GDPR banner [secureprivacy.ai].
- Text content is available at least in German and English and can be extended to other languages.
- Non-EU visitors may see a US or UK banner (story specified separately).

## Detailed Description

### Geo-targeting functionality
Detecting the user’s origin is crucial for showing the correct banner:

1. **Methods of geolocation**:
   - IP-based geolocation (primary method)
   - Browser language settings as fallback or additional indicator
   - Optional: consider previous user selection (e.g., if the user explicitly chose a region/language)

2. **Regional distinction**:
   - EU/EEA countries: GDPR-compliant banner with all requirements
   - USA: CCPA/CPRA-compliant banner (with "Do Not Sell My Personal Information" option)
   - UK: UK GDPR-compliant banner (similar to GDPR)
   - Other regions: basic banner or none, depending on local laws

3. **Error handling**:
   - If origin is uncertain, display the strictest banner (GDPR)
   - If geolocation has technical problems: fallback to GDPR banner

### Multilingualism
Language support must be comprehensive:

1. **Supported languages**:
   - Minimum: German and English
   - Recommended: all EU official languages, especially for internationally active companies
   - Must be extendable for additional languages

2. **Language detection and selection**:
   - Automatic detection of the browser language
   - Fallback to English if the detected language is not supported
   - Optional: allow users to change the language manually

3. **Translation management**:
   - All texts must be managed in a central translation system
   - No hardcoded texts in the code
   - Translation keys should be semantically named (e.g., "cookie.banner.accept_all")

### Technical Implementation
1. **Geolocation service**:
   - Integrate a reliable geolocation service (e.g., MaxMind, ipstack)
   - Cache results for performance optimization
   - Process IP addresses in compliance with data protection (anonymization after geolocation)

2. **Internationalization system**:
   - Use a robust i18n framework
   - Support pluralization and context-dependent translations
   - Ability to dynamically load language packs

3. **Performance optimization**:
   - Geolocation should not noticeably impact load time
   - Language packs should be compact and efficiently loaded
   - Caching strategies for returning visitors

### Legal Requirements
This story meets the requirement that privacy notices must be presented in a language understandable to the user. It also ensures that the correct legal requirements are met depending on the region.

### Test Scenarios
1. Geolocation test – access with different IP addresses (EU, USA, UK, etc.)
2. Language test – verify all supported languages for correct translation and display
3. Fallback test – behavior when languages are unsupported or geolocation fails
4. Performance test – measure load time with geolocation and various language packs
