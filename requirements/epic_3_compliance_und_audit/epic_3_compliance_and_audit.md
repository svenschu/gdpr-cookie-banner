# Epic 3: Compliance and Audit

## Epic Description

This epic covers all requirements to ensure GDPR compliance and auditability of the cookie banner system. The system should provide complete documentation, tamper-proof logging, avoidance of dark patterns, and correct legal bases for cookie use.

## Business Value

- **Legal compliance**: Full fulfillment of GDPR documentation and auditability requirements
- **Risk minimization**: Avoidance of fines due to manipulative designs or incomplete documentation
- **Audit readiness**: Proof of GDPR conformity through comprehensive logging
- **Trust building**: Transparent and ethical data processing strengthens user trust

## Scope and Exclusions

### In Scope:
- Tamper-proof consent logging with at least five-year retention
- Automated cookie list and documentation maintenance
- Dark-pattern avoidance and UX compliance tests
- Correct application of legal bases for cookie categories
- Audit reports and compliance monitoring

### Out of Scope:
- Specific third-party audit tools (evaluated individually)
- Legal advice on cookie categorization (requires external legal counsel)
- Other compliance standards besides GDPR (handled in separate epics)

## User Stories

This epic includes the following user stories:

- **[Story 3.1](user_stories/story_3.1_consent_logging_and_data_protection.md)** – Consent logging and data protection
- **[Story 3.2](user_stories/story_3.2_maintain_cookie_list_and_documentation.md)** – Maintain cookie list and documentation
- **[Story 3.3](user_stories/story_3.3_test_dark_pattern_avoidance.md)** – Test dark pattern avoidance
- **[Story 3.4](user_stories/story_3.4_legitimate_interest_vs_consent.md)** – Legitimate interest vs. consent

## Technical Framework

### Architectural Principles

- **Audit by Design**: Tamper-proof logging of all consent actions from the start
- **Data Integrity**: Immutable and traceable storage of compliance data
- **Privacy by Default**: Privacy-friendly defaults and minimal data collection
- **Transparency First**: Complete and understandable documentation of all cookie uses

### Compliance Requirements

- **GDPR Compliance**: Fulfillment of all documentation and auditability requirements
- **Tamper-proof**: Immutable logging with at least five-year retention
- **Dark pattern free**: Ethical UX design without manipulative elements
- **Legal correctness**: Use only permissible legal bases

### Integration Requirements

- **Logging infrastructure**: Central and secure storage of all compliance data
- **Audit tools**: Automated generation of compliance and audit reports
- **Cookie scanner**: Automated detection and categorization of website cookies
- **Role-based access**: Secure and controlled access management to compliance data

## Priority and Dependencies

**Priority**: High priority (P1)

**Rationale**: This epic is critical for legal compliance, as GDPR violations can lead to significant fines. Auditability is essential to demonstrate GDPR conformity and protect against legal consequences.

**Dependencies**:
- Incoming dependencies: Epic 1 (consent banner core functions) must be completed
- Legal prerequisites: Assessment of cookie categories and legal bases must be available
- Technical infrastructure: Logging infrastructure and backup systems must be available
- Organizational requirements: Data protection officer must define audit requirements

## Acceptance Criteria (Epic Level)

- **Complete logging**: All consent actions are logged tamper-proof with at least five-year retention
- **Automated documentation**: Cookie list is maintained automatically and versioned
- **Dark pattern free**: UX design is free of manipulative elements and ethically correct
- **Legal correctness**: All cookie categories use only permissible legal bases
- **Audit readiness**: Complete compliance and audit reports can be generated at any time
